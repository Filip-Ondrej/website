## Section Title (Use H2)

Opening paragraphs. Set context. 2-3 sentences max per paragraph for readability.

Another paragraph. Keep momentum. Show don't tell - use specific moments, not generalizations.

### Subsection (Use H3 for smaller breaks)

More detail here. This is where you dive into specifics.

**Bold key moments** or important phrases. Use sparingly - only for emphasis.

![IMAGE-1]

*Image appears here. Will show images[1] from frontmatter with its caption.*

Continue story after image. The visual break prevents monotony. Reader's eyes get rest, context reinforced.

> Use blockquotes for pull quotes. These should be YOUR voice - something you said/thought in the moment. Make it memorable. 15-25 words max.

More paragraphs continuing narrative. Keep moving forward. Don't repeat information.

Another paragraph. Vary sentence length. Short impactful sentences. Then longer explanatory ones that provide context and depth.

![IMAGE-2]

*Second image appears here. Strategic placement after major story beat.*

### Another Section

Continue building tension or showing progression.

List format when appropriate:
- **Bullet 1:** Keep concise
- **Bullet 2:** Start with bold label for scannability
- **Bullet 3:** Each bullet should be complete thought

Return to prose. Lists break rhythm but use sparingly - only when structure helps clarity.

> Another pull quote at natural break point. These create visual rhythm every 300-400 words. Essential for sustained attention.

![IMAGE-3]

*Third image. Proof point or climax moment visual.*

### Final Section

Resolution. What happened. Specific results.

What it meant beyond the numbers. The insight. The pattern revealed.

![IMAGE-4]

*Final image if needed. Otherwise this goes to gallery at end.*

## Writing Guidelines

**Image Placement Strategy:**
- `![IMAGE-1]` = First story image (after setup, before main action)
- `![IMAGE-2]` = Mid-story (during crisis/action)
- `![IMAGE-3]` = Near climax (proof/result moment)
- `![IMAGE-4]` = Conclusion (celebration/reflection)

Use 2-4 images per story. More than 4 becomes gallery dump.

**Pull Quote Rules:**
- Extract key moment quotes from your narrative
- Your voice, your words
- 15-25 words optimal
- Place every 300-400 words (2-3 per story)
- Creates visual breathing room

**Paragraph Length:**
- 2-3 sentences max
- One idea per paragraph
- White space = readability

**Section Headers:**
- H2 (##) for major beats (Setup, Crisis, Resolution)
- H3 (###) for subsections
- Keep headers short (2-5 words)

**Bold/Emphasis:**
- **Bold** for key phrases (1-2 per section max)
- *Avoid italics except in pull quotes*
- Don't overuse - dilutes impact

**Metrics:**
- Appear automatically at top
- Reference inline when relevant: "After **48 hours** debugging..."
- Let numbers tell story contextually

## The Formula for 10/10 Engagement:

```
Paragraphs (2-3)
↓
[IMAGE or PULL QUOTE]
↓
Paragraphs (2-3)
↓
[IMAGE or PULL QUOTE]
↓
Repeat pattern
```

**Visual anchor every 150-200 words keeps momentum.**

Never go more than 400 words without image/quote/heading break.
